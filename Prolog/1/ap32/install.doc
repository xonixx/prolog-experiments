We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the included documentation
and carefully read the README.DOC file.  This file contains information
located NOWHERE ELSE. Additionally, you should always refer to the
ERRORS.HLP file for information on any errors you may receive.

You will need to modify your environment to use Arity/Prolog.  Assuming
that you installed using the defaults, you need to add the following
to your CONFIG.SYS file:

    Add C:\ARITY32\DLL to your LIBPATH (OS/2 only)
    Add C:\ARITY32\BIN to your PATH variable
    Add C:\ARITY32\LIB to your LIB variable

(In OS/2 you modify CONFIG.SYS.  In Windows 95 you modify AUTOEXEC.BAT.
